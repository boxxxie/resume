    "summary": "I'm currently a full stack developer, with a lot of emphasis on the front end. I have a love-hate relationship with JavaScript and EMACS. I've been programming since I was in grade school (over 16 years), thus having experience in a lot of languages and tools. Some of which I'm a bit glad that I've forgotten about. I read way too much hacker news, and spend a lot of time on IRC asking for help or giving it",
